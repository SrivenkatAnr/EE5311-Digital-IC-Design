Design a 2-input unit AND gate by cascading a NAND2 with an INVERTER.

> To be shown to your assigned TA in the tutorial on Wednesday

Schematic of NAND2, INVERTER, and AND2 gate

DRC and LVS clean NAND2, INVERTER, and AND2 gate

Characterized rise and fall delay of the NAND2 gate as a function of Fan-out 0-8 (NAND2 driving identical copies of itself).

The schematic and layout of each gate

DRC and LVS results

Rise and Fall delay of the NAND2 gate tabulated vs fan-out

Gate sizes:
INV_1X : 1X (Unit) inverter: L=2λ,Wn=4λ,Wp=8λ

INV_2X : 2X inverter : L=2λ,Wn=8λ,Wp=16λ

INV_4X : 4X inverter : L=2λ,Wn=16λ,Wp=32λ 


NAND2_1X : 1X (Unit) NAND2: L=2λ,Wn=8λ,Wp=8λ

NAND2_2X : 2X NAND2 : L=2λ,Wn=16λ,Wp=16λ

NAND2_4X : 4X NAND2 : L=2λ,Wn=32λ,Wp=32λ
