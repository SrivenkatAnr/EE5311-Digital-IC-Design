# Signed Eight-bit Carry Save Multiplier

	Design a signed 8 bit Carry Save multiplier (CSM) with a ripple adder in the final vector merge stage.

# Deliverables to be shown to TA

* Transistor schematic
* The use of NAND gates and the inverting full adders
* The size of the NAND gate that enables the CSM to function at maximum speed while keeping the area down a minimum.
* The configuration of the Full Adder schematic that enables the CSM to function at maximum speed while keeping the area down to a minimum
* Schematic simulation to show the functionality of the multiplier on a select set of inputs chosen appropriately.

# Submission on Moodle

A single PDF showing
* The schematic of the CSM showing clearly the use of NAND gates and the inverting adders
* Schematic simulation to show the functionality of the multiplier on a select set of inputs chosen appropriately.
* The configuration of the FA that was found to be suitable for the CSM with simulations to justify the same
* The size of the NAND gate with the justification for the same. 

### The layout of the CSM can be shown during the final evaluation of the project.
