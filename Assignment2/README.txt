The sizes are relative to a unit transistor whose dimensions are: L=2λ,Wn=4λ

Group Members:

Member 1: 1X Gate - The transistors in the blue box have 1/3 X the widths shown in the figure

Member 2: 2X Gate - The transistors in the blue box have 2/3 X the widths shown in the figure

Member 3: 3X Gate - Shown in the figure.

Note: The stack after the blue box is fixed to the standard sizing for all three members. 

Layout guidelines:
The VDD and GND lines should run in Metal-2
The VDD−GND pitch should be the same for all cells (NAND, AND, Full adder) = 50λ 
Break wide transistor into smaller parallel ones - This will help reduce the Y dimension 
The aspect ratio of the cell should be reasonable
